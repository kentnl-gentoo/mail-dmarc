Determine if a domain exists, reliably. The DMARC draft says:

  9.6 If the RFC5322.From domain does not exist in the DNS, Mail Receivers
      SHOULD direct the receiving SMTP server to reject the message {R9}.

And in Appendix A.4:

   A common practice among MTA operators, and indeed one documented in
   [ADSP], is a test to determine domain existence prior to any more
   expensive processing.  This is typically done by querying the DNS for
   MX, A or AAAA resource records for the name being evaluated, and
   assuming the domain is non-existent if it could be determined that no
   such records were published for that domain name.

   The original pre-standardization version of this protocol included a
   mandatory check of this nature.  It was ultimately removed, as the
   method's error rate was too high without substantial manual tuning
   and heuristic work.  There are indeed use cases this work needs to
   address where such a method would return a negative result about a
   domain for which reporting is desired, such as a registered domain
   name that never sends legitimate mail and thus has none of these
   records present in the DNS.

I went back to the ADSP (which led me to the ietf-dkim email list where
some 'experts' failed to agree on The Right Way to test domain validity. They
pointed out: MX records aren't mandatory, and A or AAAA aren't reliable.

Some experimentation proved both arguments in real world usage. This module
tests for existence by searching for a MX, NS, A, or AAAA record. Since this
search may be repeated for the Organizational Name, if the NS query fails,
there is no delegation from the TLD. That has proven very reliable.
