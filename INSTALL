# Install Mail::DMARC's dependencies

## The fast way, using your systems package manager (yum, apt, ports):

   perl bin/install_deps.pl

If your system doesn't have a package manager, or the package version fails, or the version installed by your systems package manager isn't new enough, install_deps will also attempt to install the latest version via CPAN.

Once the dependencies are installed, install Mail::DMARC as any other perl module:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install clean

Copy the mail-dmarc.ini file to your systems preferred local etc directory (/etc, /usr/local/etc, opt/local/etc) and edit at least the settings in the [organization] block:

   cp mail-dmarc.ini /etc/
   $EDITOR /etc/mail-dmarc.ini

NOTE: Most of the dependencies are optionally required for the DMARC reporting features. Mail::DMARC will perform validation with only these modules:

   Regexp::Common
   Config::Tiny
   File::ShareDir
   Net::DNS::Resolver
   Net::IP
   Socket6
