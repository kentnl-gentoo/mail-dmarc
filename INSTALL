The fast way, using your systems package manager (yum, apt, ports):

   perl bin/install_deps.pl

If your system doesn't have a package manager, or the package version fails, or the version installed by your systems package manager isn't new enough, install_deps will also attempt to install the latest version via CPAN.

Once the dependencies are installed, install Mail::DMARC as any other perl module:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install clean


NOTE: Most of the dependencies are optionally required for the DMARC reporting features. Mail::DMARC will perform validation with only these modules:

   Regexp::Common
   Config::Tiny
   File::ShareDir
   Net::DNS::Resolver
   Net::IP
   Socket6
